MNIST Image Classification

This project demonstrates a basic image classification model using a neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).
Project Structure

    czNzgcZGuNn-: This notebook cell contains the Python code for loading the dataset, building and training the neural network model, and evaluating its performance.

Dataset

The project uses the widely-used MNIST dataset, which is automatically downloaded when running the provided code. The dataset contains:

    60,000 training images and labels.
    10,000 testing images and labels.

Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image.
Model Architecture

The neural network model is a simple sequential model with the following layers:

    Flatten layer: Reshapes the 28x28 input images into a 1D array of 784 pixels.
    Dense layer: A fully connected layer with 128 neurons and a ReLU activation function.
    Dropout layer: A dropout layer with a rate of 0.2 to help prevent overfitting.
    Dense layer: A final fully connected layer with 10 neurons (one for each digit) and a softmax activation function to output probabilities for each class.

Training

The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and uses sparse categorical crossentropy as the loss function. It is trained for 5 epochs.
Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated on the test dataset using the evaluate method, which returns the loss and accuracy on the test set.
How to Run

    Open the notebook in Google Colab.
    Run the code cell czNzgcZGuNn-.
    The output will show the training progress and the final evaluation results on the test set.

Dependencies

    TensorFlow
    Keras

These dependencies are typically pre-installed in Google Colab environments.
