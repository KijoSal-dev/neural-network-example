# Neural Network Example

This project demonstrates a simple neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Features

- Loads and preprocesses the MNIST dataset
- Defines a sequential neural network with one hidden layer and dropout for regularization
- Trains the model and evaluates its accuracy

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow

## Running the Code

This project was developed and tested using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), which provides a convenient environment for running TensorFlow code without local setup.

To run the code:

1. Open [neural-example.py](neural-example.py) in Google Colab or your preferred Python environment.
2. Ensure TensorFlow is installed (`pip install tensorflow` if running locally).
3. Run the script to train and evaluate the model.
